Poster App

Poster is a simple application that demonstrates a part of social media apps like twitter and its main aim is to submitting a post.

It uses local variables to store all the values and create a scenario within one simulator to simulate a server-side scenario. It has 3 dummy users, which you can switch from a drop-down on top of the initial page.

####Posts View
Present a scrollable list of all posts submitted by 3 users including themselves. A Post include a name, username, user profileImage and text body and image. A create post button included in the view. It creates a new post via CreatePost View

####CreatePost View
Present a view in which you can enter text body and insert image via imagePicker. It also includes a done button to finish up editing and returning to the Post View.

####Known Issues
To present the text body in the Posts View, label is used that limited to 4 lines of text. If the user enters a text that occupies space less than one line, the text appears at the center not at the top left of the label.
